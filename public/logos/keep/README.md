# Logo being tested

Copy the image you want to show on the dashboard here and name it **logo.png** or **logo.jpg**.

The app always loads the logo from this folder. Replace the file to test a different logo.

**For this dark dashboard:** use a **light** logo (white or light grey) or your **transparent** version so it stands out on the dark sidebar. Avoid dark/grayscale logos—they disappear against the background.
